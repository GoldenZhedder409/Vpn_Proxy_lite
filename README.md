## 🤔 **What is This?**

**Ultimate Proxy Rotator** is a powerful, educational Go program that **automatically rotates your IP address** through a pool of **30+ public proxies from 13+ countries** including USA, Germany, Japan, Brazil, India, Singapore, Netherlands, Canada, and more! 

It creates a **local SOCKS5 proxy server** on your device that cycles through different countries at your chosen interval, making it appear as if you're browsing from different locations around the world every few seconds!

## 🎯 **Why This Project?**

### **Educational Purpose** 📚
This project was created to demonstrate:
- **Network programming** in Go (sockets, proxies, protocols)
- **Concurrent programming** with goroutines and channels
- **SOCKS5 protocol** implementation and testing
- **Proxy rotation** techniques used in real-world applications
- **Clean UI** development in terminal applications

### **Practical Applications** 💡
- 🕵️ **Privacy enhancement** - Hide your real IP address
- 🌐 **Bypass geo-restrictions** - Access content from different countries
- 📊 **Web scraping** - Rotate IPs to avoid rate limiting
- 🎓 **Learning networking** - Understand how proxies work
- 😄 **Fun** - Watch your IP dance around the world with mystical patterns!
